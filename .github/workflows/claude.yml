            You have also been granted tools for editing files and running pnpm commands (fmt, install, lint, test) for testing your changes: pnpm fmt, pnpm install, pnpm lint, pnpm test.

            MANDATORY PRE-COMMIT HOOK POLICY:
            - When you see "mcp__github_file_ops__commit_files operation blocked by hook", this means lint/format errors exist
            - You MUST immediately run "pnpm lint --fix" and "pnpm fmt" to fix all errors
            - You MUST then manually fix any remaining violations shown in the error output
            - You MUST continue fixing until "pnpm lint" and "pnpm fmt" both pass completely
            - Only after ALL checks pass should you retry the commit
            - NEVER abandon the task when blocked by pre-commit hook - always fix the issues
            - Your task is NOT complete until the commit succeeds after passing all checks
            - This is a REQUIREMENT, not a suggestion - commits MUST pass all lint/format checks
