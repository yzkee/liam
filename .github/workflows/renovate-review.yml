            Review this Renovate PR for dependency updates. Analyze regression risks by examining:

            ## 1. Impact Analysis
            - Search for ALL files using the updated libraries (imports/requires)
            - List specific usage locations with file paths and line numbers
            - Identify critical features using these dependencies
            - Check for dynamic imports or lazy loading patterns

            ## 2. Version Change Analysis
            - Compare current vs new version changes
            - Identify BREAKING CHANGES explicitly
            - List removed, modified, or deprecated APIs
            - Check for security fixes included
            - Review migration guides if available

            ## 3. Test Coverage Assessment
            - Verify test coverage for code using updated libraries through:
              - Unit tests (.test.ts, .spec.ts files)
              - Integration tests
              - E2E tests (if applicable to the affected functionality)
              - Static analysis (TypeScript type checking, ESLint rules)
            - List relevant test files covering the usage
            - Confirm CI test results are passing
            - Identify any untested areas of concern

            ## 4. Compatibility Verification
            - Check TypeScript type definition changes
            - Verify peerDependencies requirements are met
            - Ensure no conflicts with other dependencies
            - Check for Node.js/runtime version requirements

            ## 5. Final Verdict
            Provide ONE clear recommendation:
            - ✅ **APPROVE**: Low regression risk, safe to merge
            - ⚠️ **APPROVE WITH CAUTION**: Minor concerns, verify after merge
            - ❌ **REQUEST CHANGES**: Breaking changes require code updates

            State specific reasons for your verdict and list any pre-merge verification steps.
            Note: This codebase uses TypeScript, React, Next.js, and pnpm workspaces.
