        This document outlines system requirements and their associated data manipulation language (DML) operations.

        ---

        ## 📋 Business Requirements

        Define database requirements for consistently managing airline-owned aircraft, operated flights, and pilots (captains and first officers) involved in operations, while maintaining scheduled and actual times for flights. This enables consistent tracking of aircraft used and personnel assigned for each flight.

        ## 🔧 Functional Requirements

        ### 1. Aircraft Management

        - The company owns multiple aircraft, each with an aircraft number, model, and seating capacity. The aircraft number must be unique, and seating capacity must be an integer greater than 0.


        **Test Cases:**

        #### 1.1. Aircraft Registration and Update

        The operations manager opens the aircraft management screen, selects "New Registration", and enters the aircraft number, model, and seating capacity. Upon clicking the register button, the system verifies required field entry, confirms aircraft number uniqueness, checks that seating capacity is a positive number, then records it in the aircraft registry.

        ##### **INSERT** - New aircraft registration test including normal cases and edge cases (capacity 1/0, model names with special characters and non-ASCII).

        \`\`\`sql
        BEGIN;
        INSERT INTO airplanes (airplane_number, model, capacity) VALUES
          ('JA100A', 'ATR42-600', 48),
          ('JA200B', 'Bombardier CRJ900', 90),
          ('JA330C', 'Flying Car Alpha', 5);
        COMMIT;
        \`\`\`

        **Execution History:**

        ✅ **06/01/2024, 08:00:00 AM**
        > 3 rows inserted

        ---

        ##### **UPDATE** - Aircraft model name and seat count update (normal update scenario for existing data).

        \`\`\`sql
        UPDATE airplanes SET model = 'ATR42-700', capacity = 50 WHERE airplane_number = 'JA100A';
        \`\`\`

        **Execution History:**

        ✅ **06/01/2024, 08:05:00 AM**
        > 1 row updated


        #### 1.2. View Flights by Aircraft

        The operations manager specifies an aircraft number on the search screen and searches with period and route conditions. The system extracts flights associated with the specified aircraft within the period and displays a list of flight names, departure times, arrival times, segments, assigned captain and first officer.

        ##### **SELECT** - Retrieve flight list within period for specified aircraft (JA100A). Verify date boundaries and flight names.

        \`\`\`sql
        SELECT f.flight_name, f.scheduled_departure, f.scheduled_arrival, f.origin, f.destination
        FROM flights f
        WHERE f.airplane_number = 'JA100A'
          AND f.scheduled_departure >= '2024-06-01 00:00:00+09'
          AND f.scheduled_arrival <= '2024-06-02 23:59:59+09'
        ORDER BY f.scheduled_departure;
        \`\`\`

        **Execution History:**

        ✅ **06/02/2024, 10:00:00 AM**
        > 2 rows returned


        ---

        ### 2. Flight Information Management

        - Flight information includes flight name, departure time, arrival time, origin, destination, aircraft number, captain ID, first officer ID, start time, and end time. Origin and destination cannot be the same, and scheduled times must satisfy departure time < arrival time.


        **Test Cases:**

        #### 2.1. Flight Schedule Creation

        The schedule coordinator enters flight name, departure time, arrival time, origin, and destination on the flight creation screen, then selects aircraft number and pilot IDs. The system validates the input values before saving.

        ##### **INSERT** - Representative flight creation (Tokyo to Osaka route)

        \`\`\`sql
        INSERT INTO flights (id, flight_name, origin, destination, scheduled_departure, scheduled_arrival, airplane_number, captain_id, first_officer_id)
        VALUES ('fc70279f-04d3-41ea-97e9-3a1bb7ee358f', 'JAL101', 'Tokyo', 'Osaka', '2024-06-01 08:00:00+09', '2024-06-01 09:10:00+09', 'JA100A', 'P0001', 'P0002');
        \`\`\`

        **Execution History:**

        ✅ **05/30/2024, 02:00:00 PM**
        > 1 row inserted


        #### 2.2. Recording Actual Flight Times

        After operation, the operations coordinator opens the target flight details screen and enters the start time (actual departure) and end time (actual arrival) then saves.

        ##### **UPDATE** - Record actual departure and arrival times simultaneously (normal case including delays).

        \`\`\`sql
        UPDATE flights SET actual_start = '2024-06-01 08:05:00+09', actual_end = '2024-06-01 09:12:00+09'
        WHERE id = 'fc70279f-04d3-41ea-97e9-3a1bb7ee358f';
        \`\`\`

        **Execution History:**

        ✅ **06/01/2024, 09:15:00 AM**
        > 1 row updated


        ---

        ### 3. Pilot Management

        - Each flight is operated by a captain and first officer, each with an ID, name, and phone number. Pilot IDs must be unique, and for flights, the captain ID and first officer ID cannot be the same person.


        **Test Cases:**

        #### 3.1. Pilot (Captain/First Officer) Registration

        HR or operations manager selects "New Registration" from the pilot roster screen and enters pilot ID, name, and phone number then saves.

        ##### **INSERT** - Multiple pilot registration (diverse name and phone number formats)

        \`\`\`sql
        INSERT INTO pilots (pilot_id, name, phone) VALUES
          ('P0001', 'Taro Sato', '+81-90-1234-5678'),
          ('P0002', 'Hanako Yamada', '+81-90-2345-6789');
        \`\`\`

        **Execution History:**

        ❌ **05/25/2024, 10:00:00 AM**
        > ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pk_pilots"

        ✅ **05/25/2024, 10:05:00 AM**
        > 2 rows inserted


        ---

        ### 4. Data Integrity and Validation

        - Enforce referential integrity through foreign keys and implement various business rules through CHECK constraints. Protect related data with ON DELETE RESTRICT during deletions.


        **Test Cases:**

        #### 4.1. Referential Integrity Verification

        Verify that the system properly returns errors when attempting to delete aircraft with existing flights or pilots assigned to flights.

        ##### **DELETE** - Delete aircraft with remaining flights (expecting referential integrity error: ON DELETE RESTRICT).

        \`\`\`sql
        DELETE FROM airplanes WHERE airplane_number = 'JA330C';
        \`\`\`

        **Execution History:**

        ❌ **06/03/2024, 11:00:00 AM**
        > ERROR: update or delete on table "airplanes" violates foreign key constraint "fk_flights_airplane"



        ## 📊 Non-Functional Requirements

        ### 1. Performance

        - The system must be able to search 1000 flight records within 3 seconds and support concurrent access from 50 users.


        ---

        ### 2. Security

        - Pilot personal information must be encrypted for storage and access logs must be recorded. Database access must be restricted to authenticated users only.
